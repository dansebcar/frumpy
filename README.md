# Dictapp Dictionary App

A small Django web app with an API that remembers any definitions you throw at it and records a hit each time you do. Designed for use with my [Oxford Dictionaries API Client](https://github.com/dansebcar/oxford).

This was originally forked from the excellent [Getting Started with Python on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) article
